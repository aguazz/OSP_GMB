# Optimal stopping problem of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridge

## Description: 
Computes the Optimal Stopping Boundary (OSB) that maximizes the mean of an Gauss-Markov Bridge (GMB)

## Details:
A Picard's iteration algorithm is implemented to solve the free-boundary equation that characterizes the OSB of a GMB. Details can be found in the companion paper Optimal Stopping of a Gauss-Markov bridge, by D'Auria, B., García-Portugués E., and Azze A.

## Files:
* functions.R: computes the OSB related to the GMB
* examples.R: run illustrative cases
* data.R: generates and saves the data on top of which examples.R runs
* RData.zip: data generated by data.R (in RData format)
