# Optimal stopping of a time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridge

## Description: 
Computes the coefficients of a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge (OUB) that comes from conditioning a time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to hit a pinning point at some terminal time. Computes the Optimal Stopping Boundary (OSB) that solves the Optimal Stopping Problem (OSP) of the OUB.

## Details:
A Picard's iteration algorithm is implemented to solve the free-boundary equation that characterizes the OSB of the OUB. Details on this, as well as on the computation of the OUB coefficients from those of the "parent" OU process, can be found in the companion paper titled "Optimal stopping of Gauss-Markov bridges", by D'Auria, B., García-Portugués E., and Azze A.

## Files:
* functions.R: computes the OSB related to the OUB, and its slope, mean-reverting level, and volatility given the same coefficients of the "parent" OU process.
* figures.R: run illustrative cases that generate figures to either plot them in the R or save them as in .pdf format.
* data.R: generates and saves the data on top of which figures.R runs.
* RData.zip: data generated by data.R (in .RData format).
